            In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
            the whisperings and the champagne and the stars'. Everybody who is 
            anybody is seen at the glittering parties held in millionaire 
            the speculation he creates, but always seems to be watching and waiting, 
            though no one knows what for.</div>

            In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
            anybody is seen at the glittering parties held in millionaire 
            Jay Gatsby's mansion in West Egg, east of New York. The riotous

            Gatsby's origins and mysterious past.</div>
