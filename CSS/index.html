        <h1>
            The Great Gatsby
        </h1>

        <div id="box1">There was music from my neighbour's house through the summer nights. 
            In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
            the whisperings and the champagne and the stars'. Everybody who is 
            anybody is seen at the glittering parties held in millionaire 
            the speculation he creates, but always seems to be watching and waiting, 
            though no one knows what for. As the tragic story unfolds, Gatsby's 
            destructive dreams and passions are revealed, leading to disturbing 
            consequences. A brilliant evocation of 1920s high society, 
            "The Great Gatsby" peels away the layers of this glamorous world to 
            display the coldness and cruelty at its heart.</div>

            In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among 
            anybody is seen at the glittering parties held in millionaire 
            Jay Gatsby's mansion in West Egg, east of New York. The riotous 
            throng congregates in his sumptuous garden, coolly debating 
            Gatsby's origins and mysterious past. None of the frivolous socialites 
            understands him and among various rumours is the conviction 
            that 'he killed a man'. A detached onlooker, Gatsby is oblivious to 
            the speculation he creates, but always seems to be watching and waiting,
